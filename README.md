## Background

Root Finance addresses key challenges for beginner investors, including price volatility, market complexity, and limited time for monitoring. It combines Ethena's stable 13% APY on USDe with DeFi strategies, utilizing platforms like **Pendle**, **Morpho**, and **Uniswap** to optimize returns. This approach mimics traditional mutual funds with a focus on asset diversification and risk-adjusted yield.

## Features

- **Decentralized Investment Management**: Automates yield generation across multiple DeFi protocols.
- **Flexible Risk Profiles**: Users select risk profiles (Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive) that dictate asset allocation.
- **Dynamic Yield Allocation**: Funds are allocated and rebalanced according to market conditions and yield optimization.
- **Passive Income**: Users earn a stable 13% APY plus additional returns from DeFi yield strategies without active market monitoring.

## Risk Profiles

Root Finance offers three main risk profiles, each with unique asset allocations:

1. **Conservative**:
   - 60% Stable Volatility (e.g., BTC)
   - 30% Moderate Volatility (e.g., XRP)
   - 10% High Volatility (e.g., SHIB)
   
2. **Moderate**:
   - 50% Stable Volatility
   - 30% Moderate Volatility
   - 20% High Volatility

3. **Aggressive**:
   - 20% Stable Volatility
   - 20% Moderate Volatility
   - 60% High Volatility

This structure diversifies user funds according to the chosen risk profile to balance potential yield and market risk.

## Smart Contract Design

Root Finance uses a set of smart contracts to manage and automate investments:

- **Main Contract**: Manages user funds, allocates them based on risk profile, and tracks performance.
- **Risk Profile Allocation**: Distributes funds across different asset categories based on user-selected risk profile.
- **Rebalancing Mechanism**: Regularly rebalances assets to maximize yield across changing market conditions.
- **Yield Calculation**: Uses the formula `Total = Initial Investment Ã— (1 + APY)` to calculate returns.

### Key Functions

- `investFunds`: Allocates funds across various DeFi platforms based on the selected profile.
- `calculateYield`: Computes the annual yield.
